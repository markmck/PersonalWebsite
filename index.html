        About Me:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Mark and I enjoy creating tools for people and learning new things! My interest in software
        development began when my Dad taught me how to write Perl scripts in high school. If you decide to go this
        route with your child for either fun or profit, please be warned: Perl is quite possibly the worst first
        programming language to learn. But after many, many hours of suffering and anguish I can say it definitely
        prepared me for a career in software!
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my main focus is doing full-stack development for Allied Electronics and Automations. Primarily in .Net
        and Javascript for their ecommerce site. But I have also been privileged enough to have worked on embedded
        systems and websites as well as windows and mobile applications throughout my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some technologies I've been working with lately:
